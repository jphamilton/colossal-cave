Colossal Cave
=============

This is based on the [Inform 6](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/inform6lib) version of [the game](https://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/inform/Advent.inf) because I wanted a rich parser, similar to the old Infocom games like Zork and Planetfall that I grew up playing as a kid. 
I also wanted a library by the end of it that I could use to remake some of my favorite games (again Zork and Planetfall).

The source code is basically two parts. A library for writing Infocom/Inform type games and the 
Colossal Cave game itself.

The game is playable and winnable, however the library has only been implemented as far as what 
was needed to complete Colossal Cave (mostly). I am sure there are many small things that aren't 
quite right. But, it's getting there.

## Background
I have always wanted to write an object-oriented version of Colossal Cave that most people could understand, and this is that ongoing effort. This code had it's start somewhere back in 2009. 
I met a colleague at Starbuck's for a code kata - the rules being that all code had to be developed using strict TDD. 
And from that night I had the beginnings of the console input code.
