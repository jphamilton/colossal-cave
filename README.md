Colossal Cave
=============

Update 5/28/2021 - I have been working on this on and off for over 10 years. I coded myself into a hole, so this project largely sat abandoned. I recently arrived at a new abstraction that simplifies all the code and will allow me to finish!

(work in progress)

I have always wanted to write an object-oriented version of Colossal Cave that normal people like me could understand, and this is that ongoing effort. This code had it's start somewhere back in 2009. 
I met a colleague at Starbuck's for a code kata - the rules being that all code had to be developed using strict TDD. 
And from that night I had the beginnings of the console input code. 

This is based on the [Inform 6](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/inform6lib) version of [the game](https://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/inform/Advent.inf) because I wanted a rich parser, similar to the old Infocom games like Zork and Planetfall that I grew up playing as a kid.
