Implicit Actions
----------------
Need to figure out how to map [Held] attribute to implicit handlers. Only Take is supported.
Works for Eat

> eat food
(first taking the tasty food)
Delicious

But there is no way to currently figure out which "implicit" action to run for other situations

MAYBE this is done by the Verb itself when the [Held] is an indirect object (e.g. unlock grate)

DROP: Implicit drop works if there is only 1 item in inventory - works with just "drop" and also "drop all" 

UNLOCK: Implicit unlock works if the key is the only item in inventory, otherwise "What do you want to unlock the <object> with?"

Nested command handling
---------------------------------
> "turn on"
What do you want to turn on?


// user can respond "lamp" and previous command is still in context
// or user can type "turn on lamp" and a whole new command is generated


---------
<noun> - can be held, in the room or up to the code to decide
<held> - one item im inventory
<multi> - multiple <noun> (objects)
<multiheld> - multiple objects in inventory
